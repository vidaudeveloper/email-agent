2. Update hot cache Key Metrics (ROAS/CPA deltas, de-duped conversion counts)

## Archive Management

### Monthly

3. Create snapshot: memory/monitoring/snapshots/YYYY-MM-hot-cache-snapshot.md
4. Compress old rank-history exports
5. Update glossary with new terms
6. Run the consolidation/reflection pass (dedup + supersession + distill) — see [Consolidation Pass](consolidation-pass.md) / memory-management step 7

### Quarterly
1. Review entire cold storage structure
2. Compress files older than 6 months
3. Create quarterly summary report
4. Audit active campaigns -> archive completed ones
